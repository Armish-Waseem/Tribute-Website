                <h2>The Angel of Mercy</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Abdul Sattar Edhi </b>(February 28, 1928 – July 8, 2016) was a
                    renowned Pakistani humanitarian and philanthropist, often called the
                    "Angel of Mercy." He founded the Edhi Foundation in 1951, which
                    became Pakistan's largest social welfare organization, running
                    hospitals, orphanages, homeless shelters, and the world's largest
                    volunteer ambulance network. Edhi's tireless dedication to helping
                    the needy, regardless of their background, earned him global
                    recognition and numerous awards. Despite his vast humanitarian
                    impact, he lived modestly, reflecting his commitment to selflessness
                    and compassion. His legacy lives on through the continued work of
                    the Edhi Foundation.
